Python with RabbitMQâ€”simplified so you won't have to.

Features
--------
Stop worrying about boilerplating and implementing retry logic on your queues. PyRMQ already
does it for you.

- Use out-of-the-box and thread-safe :class:`~pyrmq.Consumer` and :class:`~pyrmq.Publisher` classes created from `pika`_ for your projects and tests.
- Built-in retry logic for connecting, consuming, and publishing. Can also handle infinite retries.
- Message priorities
- Works with Python 3.
- Production ready

Quickstart
----------
PyRMQ is available at `PyPI`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyrmq

Just instantiate the feature you want with their respective settings.
PyRMQ already works out of the box with RabbitMQ's `default initialization settings`_.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrmq import Publisher
    publisher = Publisher(
        exchange_name="exchange_name",
        queue_name="queue_name",
        routing_key="routing_key",
    )
    publisher.publish({"pyrmq": "My first message"})

Publish message with priorities
-------------------------------
To enable prioritization of messages, instantiate your queue with the queue
argument `x-max-priority`. It takes an integer that sets the number of possible
priority values with a higher number commanding more priority. Then, simply
publish your message with the priority argument specified. Any number higher
than the set max priority is floored or considered the same.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrmq import Publisher
    publisher = Publisher(
        exchange_name="exchange_name",
        queue_name="queue_name",
        routing_key="routing_key",
        queue_args={"x-max-priority": 3}
    )
    publisher.publish({"pyrmq": "My first message"}, priority=1)

.. warning::

    Adding arguments on an existing queue is not possible. If you wish to add queue arguments,
    you will need to either delete the existing queue then recreate the queue with arguments or simply
    make a new queue with the arguments.

Consuming
----------
Instantiating a :class:`~pyrmq.Consumer` automatically starts it in its own thread making it
non-blocking by default. When run after the code from before, you should be
able to receive the published data.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrmq import Consumer


    def callback(data):
        print(f"Received {data}!")

    consumer = Consumer(
        exchange_name="exchange_name",
        queue_name="queue_name",
        routing_key="routing_key",
    )

    consumer.start()
