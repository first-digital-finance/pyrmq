# Documentation Guidelines

- Update docs/api.rst when adding or changing public methods
- Update examples in docs/usage.rst for new features
- Keep README examples up to date with API changes
- Ensure examples are properly formatted with code blocks
- Documentation is built with Sphinx and hosted on ReadTheDocs

## Module Documentation

```python
"""
