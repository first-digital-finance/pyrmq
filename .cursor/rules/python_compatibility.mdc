# Python Compatibility and Build System

## Python Version Support
- PyRMQ requires Python 3.11 or newer
- Officially supported versions: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- Tests run across all supported Python versions
- Use modern Python features and libraries

## Build System
- Uses hatchling build backend
- Dependencies are specified in pyproject.toml
- Project metadata is defined in pyproject.toml
- No setup.py is needed

## PyProject.toml Example
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "PyRMQ"
version = "3.4.5"
description = "Python with RabbitMQâ€”simplified so you won't have to."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
license = {text = "MIT"}
# ...other metadata...

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "pre-commit>=3.6.0",
]
docs = [
    "sphinx>=8.2.3",
    "PyYAML>=6.0.1",
]
test = [
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
]
```

## Specifying Python Versions in Classifiers
```toml
classifiers = [
    # ...other classifiers...
    "Programming Language :: Python",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14",
]
```
