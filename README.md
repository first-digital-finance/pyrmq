  <p>Python with RabbitMQâ€”simplified so you won't have to.</p>
</div>

## Features
Stop worrying about boilerplating and implementing retry logic for your queues. PyRMQ already
does it for you.
- Use out-of-the-box and thread-safe `Consumer` and `Publisher` classes created from `pika` for your projects and tests.
- Built-in retry-backoff logic for connecting, consuming, and publishing. 
- Works with Python 3.
- Production ready

## Getting Started
### Installation
PyRMQ is available at PyPi.
```shell script
pip install pyrmq
```
### Usage
#### Publishing
Just instantiate the feature you want with their respective settings.
PyRMQ already works out of the box with RabbitMQ's [default initialization settings](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq).
```python
from pyrmq import Publisher
publisher = Publisher(
    exchange_name="exchange_name",
    queue_name="queue_name",
    routing_key="routing_key",
)
publisher.publish({"pyrmq": "My first message"})
```
#### Consuming
Intantiating a `Consumer` automatically starts it in its own thread making it
non-blocking by default. When run after the code from before, you should be
able to receive the published data.
```python
from pyrmq import Consumer

def callback(data):
    print(f"Received {data}!")

consumer = Consumer(
    exchange_name="exchange_name",
    queue_name="queue_name",
    routing_key="routing_key",
    callback=callback
)
consumer.start()
```
